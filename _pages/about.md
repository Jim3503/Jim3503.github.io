I'm a first-year master's student at the [College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, multimodal learning, large models, and training deep learning models on large datasets.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yunlong Yu]([https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/10054748](https://ee.jlu.edu.cn/info/1018/1770.htm)) from the [College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by [Prof. Liang Shen](https://ee.jlu.edu.cn/info/1018/1770.htm) from the State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, Jilin University.
